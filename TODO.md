# Work that Jacques UNG wanted to do next

Some work is uncomplete or can be improved. Here is what Jacques UNG wanted to do but couldn't because of time:
- [BUG TO CORRECT] With high volume of documents, for the super pipe, the measurement pipe file `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/py_files/extract_measurements_from_brat.py` seems not to be accessed by the sbatch file which execute the super pipe at `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/py_files/sbatch/main_with_parts.sh`. Locally, the measurements pipe can be executed no matter the number of parsed documents.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Parallelize `remove_labels_from_label_key` method from `line 123` to `line 193` from measurements pipe file: `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/py_files/extract_measurements_from_brat.py`. A parallelization can be done with the `for` loop at `line 160` on a term level and should be more than appreciated to speed up this simple process which, however, is estimated at > > 1 day execution time for 600k terms to parse.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Parallelize `get_measurements_from_tables` method from `line 212` to `line 284` from measurements pipe file: `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/py_files/extract_measurements_from_brat.py`. A parallelization can be done with the `for` loop at `line 270` on a documents level and should be more than appreciated to speed up this medium cost process.
- [TO FINISH] Finish fine tuning of CODER-EDS. Just execute `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/normalisation/py_files/train_coder.sh` file up to 1M iterations (To know the number of iteration, just take a look at where the weigths of CODER-EDS are saved, i.e at `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/data_bio/coder_output`. The files are saved with the number of iterations in their names.). Evaluate this model then with the files in `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/normalisation/notebooks/coder` for example.
- [TO FINISH] Finish Notebook at `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/notebooks/get_stats_by_section_on_cim10.ipynb`, i.e code for histograms (data is already parsed).
- [TO FINISH] Infer `super_pipe` on the documents linked to the 4 diseases lupus, takayasu, sclerodermie and syndrome des anti-phospholipides at `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/data_bio/super_pipe_get_stats_by_section_on_cim10` and then plot histogram(s) (one document for frequency per document and an other for value distribution if It is a quantitative measure) per biological entity using the file at `/export/home/cse200093/Jacques_Bio/super_pipe/notebooks/get_stats_by_section_on_cim10.ipynb` (Code for histogram to do).
