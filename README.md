# Work folder by Jacques UNG

This folder contains all the work done by Jacques UNG during Its 4 month internship from April 2023 to July 2023. It contains the three parts of the biology normalisation pipe, i.e :
- The extraction pipe (It is not the used version)
- The measurement pipe
- The normalization of the extracted entities

As a newcomer, please start with the folder `SUPER_README` which contains a brief introduction about the project, Its aims and actual limits.
Almost each subfolder important for the state of the art normalization pipe contains a `README.md` describing briefly what does each file. Moreover, each code files are documented.

The folders in the root of this project are :
- `data-bio`: All the data used in all our experiments and all the results that these experiments generated. (Except data used / generated by rule-based extractor (`eds-nlp_umls` folder) which stores Its content in Its folder)
- `eds-nlp_annotations`:  Measurements extractor
- `eds-nlp_umls`: Rule-based NER. NOT STATE OF THE ART (SOA)
- `edsnlp`: CUSTOM edsnlp library with essentially modified `eds.tables` and modified `eds.measurements` pipe
- `nlstruct`: BERT based NER. NOT SOA
- `normalisation`: Normalisator of bio entities.
- `resultats`: Sum-up of major results obtained during these 4 months.
- `super_pipe`: Entire pipe from extraction to normalisation through measurements pipe.
- `SUPER_README`: General project description
