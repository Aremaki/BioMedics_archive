# Reproducibility

To guarantee the reproducibility of our models, we rely on virtual environments and VCS tools.

## Environments
We use [Poetry](https://github.com/poetry/poetry) to validate the constraints generated by the dependencies of our model, and lock the versions that were used to generate a model, in a `poetry.lock` file.

This file can be reused to reinstall a previous environment by running
```bash
poetry install
```

## Versioning

We use [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) to version the experiences, models and datasets used.

To add and version a new dataset, run
```bash
dvc import-url url/or/path/to/your/dataset data/dataset
```

To (re-)train a model and package it, just run:
```bash
dvc repro
```

For more information about DVC, make sure to visit their [documentation](https://dvc.org).
